# Week 7: Code Reviews 

This week, we are going to introduce a new style of code review.

At times during the week, starting on Wednesday, we will start reviewing your code by viewing it on GitHub and attempting to run it. 

Please always have running code on your *master* branch and update the *README* to reflect any recent changes. Make sure you have clear instructions on how to run tests and run the application.

We will leave comments as open issues in your GitHub repo.
